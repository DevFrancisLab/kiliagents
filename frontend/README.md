# KiliAgents - AI-Powered Multi-Agent Platform for Smarter Communities

## üåü Overview

KiliAgents is an innovative AI-powered multi-agent platform designed to transform urban communities through intelligent coordination and real-time problem-solving. Built specifically to address the challenges facing Kilimani's rapid urbanization, this platform demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can work together to create smarter, more sustainable communities.

## üéØ Project Purpose

### The Challenge
Kilimani faces critical urban challenges:
- **Uncontrolled Development**: 900 units per acre density on Kindaruma Road
- **Infrastructure Failure**: 60% water/sanitation system failure rate
- **Environmental Degradation**: 50% tree cover loss
- **Economic Displacement**: 35% SME business closure rate
- **Safety Concerns**: Increased security incidents and emergency response challenges

### The Solution
KiliAgents addresses these challenges through a coordinated multi-agent AI system that:
- Monitors community metrics in real-time
- Automatically assigns issues to appropriate agents
- Facilitates communication between residents, authorities, and stakeholders
- Provides predictive analytics for proactive community management
- Ensures transparent and accountable governance

## ü§ñ AI Agent Architecture

### Core Agents
1. **Development Agent** - Monitors construction permits, zoning compliance, and sustainable development
2. **Environment Agent** - Tracks air quality, green space preservation, and environmental impact
3. **Social Cohesion Agent** - Facilitates community engagement and conflict resolution
4. **SME Support Agent** - Identifies business opportunities and supports local enterprises
5. **Safety Agent** - Coordinates emergency response and monitors security incidents

### Agent Coordination
All agents communicate through a central coordination system, sharing insights and collaborating to provide holistic solutions for community challenges.
